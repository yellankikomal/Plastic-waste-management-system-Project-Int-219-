						<h3>But let us first know how these landfills work.</h3>
						<h4>But what made people switch to plastic?</h4>
						<p>A landfill site is a location that has been prepared for the purpose of dumping waste, rubbish, or debris. The law states that landfill sites must be located away from inhabited areas and areas used for farming or drinking water.</p>
						<h3>IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
						<p>With the increase in plastic usage, its impact on the environment has grown gradually. But it wasnâ€™t until the late 20th century, did people realize the detrimental effects. This led to environmental movements and awareness campaigns like Earth Day, Plastic-free July, and a global initiative called International Coastal Cleanup, and many more began highlighting the impacts of plastic pollution as a growing concern.</p>
						<p>
							Waste is crushed and compacted so it occupies as little space as possible, then transported in lorries to outdoor landfill sites, where it is dumped and buried under soil layers to decompose.</p>
							<p>But we need to realize that much of this waste takes years to decompose due to the conditions of the landfill sites, where there is little oxygen and moisture, and the characteristics of the materials.</p>
                            <p>Also, The continuous indiscriminate disposal of solid waste is accelerating. It is linked to poverty, poor governance, urbanization, population growth, poor living standards, low environmental awareness, and inadequate management.</p>

                            <h3>IMPACTS OF LANDFILLS</h3>
                            <h4>How do these landfills impact us?</h4>
                            <p>There are numerous impacts of landfills, environmentally as well as socially.
